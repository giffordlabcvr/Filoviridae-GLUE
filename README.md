Welcome to Filovirus-GLUE, a resource for comparative genomic analysis of filoviruses, developed using the [GLUE software framework](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools).

**[GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/gluetools)** is an open, integrated software toolkit designed for storing and interpreting sequence data. It supports the creation of bespoke projects, incorporating essential data items for comparative genomic analysis, such as sequences, multiple sequence alignments, genome feature annotations, and other associated data.

Projects are loaded into the GLUE "engine," forming a relational database that represents the semantic relationships between data items. This foundation supports systematic comparative analyses and the development of sequence-based resources.

**Filovirus-GLUE** contains genome feature definitions, multiple sequence alignments, and annotated reference sequences for all filovirus species included in the [most recent ICTV report](https://ictv.global/report/chapter/filoviridae/filoviridae).

This **Filovirus-GLUE**  project can be extended with additional layers, openly available via GitHub, including **[Filovirus-GLUE-EVE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Filovirus-GLUE-EVE)**, which extends Filovirus-GLUE through the incorporation of endogenous filoviral elements.

Please see the **[User Guide](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Filovirus-GLUE/wiki)** for more details.
