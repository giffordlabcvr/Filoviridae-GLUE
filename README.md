# Filoviridae-EVE

## Description

Filoviridae-EVE is an open source virus sequence data resource focussed on endogenous filoviral elements (EFiV).

Filoviridae-EVE is based on [GLUE](http://tools.glue.cvr.ac.uk), an open source, data-centric bioinformatics environment specialised for the analysis of virus sequence data.

We have created a core project - [Filoviridae-GLUE](https://github.com/giffordlabcvr/Filoviridae-GLUE) - for analysing filovirus (family <i>Filoviridae</i>) sequence data generally, and Filoviridae-EVE is an extension to this project. 
Filoviridae-GLUE contains reference information the filovirus family, including reference sequences representing all recognised filovirus species. It also contains alignments, trees, and other auxilliary data.

## What's the point of this resource

EFV sequences provide a unique source of retrospective information about the long-term evolution of filoviruses.

## Standard nomenclature for EFV loci

This project applies a standard nomenclature to EFV loci, following the model described for ERVs in paper cited below, except using the classifier 'ECV' rather than ERV.
